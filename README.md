### How to suggest a registry?

1. Make sure the registry is not already listed in the directory.
2. Ensure the registry uses **shadcn** as its distribution method  
   (e.g., `npx shadcn@latest https://custom-registry.com/{component}`).
3. Add the registry entry at the bottom of the [`registries.json`](https://github.com/rbadillap/registry.directory/blob/main/apps/web/public/registries.json) file.
